# Why this technologies

Using a framework with I'm comfortable with hekps me a lot to achieve the goals, almost all, vue has a easy approach a low learning curve it's  a good framework and helps doing a lot of things faster.

The use of libraries it's to save time especially when some implementations like drag and drop native html5 it hasn't a reactive approach for vuejs. Other special issue it's time manipulation so, I consider it's better and a good practice to use a well tested librarie.

The ecosystem vue has it's bigger and the community help it's big, some "bugs" can be resolve in days due to this commiment from people.

For me vue helps me in focus to solve problems and no waste so much time, specially that currently work in a one member team, without frameworks and libraries develop by other the time consuming would be much gratter.

The css scope per component that vue offers it's a sandbox and focused design that helps to desing easily, even for me.

The key point to choose vue was the experince I had working with him, even a los has changed from v2 to v3 I decided to take the new approach and it was easy to get trough.

Thanks you in advance.

#### The end... for now.
